On my VM supported by a Windows 8.1 ultrabook with hardware:
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3537U CPU @ 2.00GHz on AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
my fastest configuration is:
configuration ('blocked', 32, 8): 0.00699804 seconds

Blocked was consistently at least an order of magnitude faster than coalesced because blocked reads take advantage of CPU prefetching. Since my machine only has 4 cores, too many work groups or workers would caused context-switching overhead and be unable to run in parallel, thus worsening the time.

On Odyssey with hardware: Tesla K40m on NVIDIA CUDA (GPU) my fastest configuration is:
configuration ('coalesced', 512, 128): 0.00032384 seconds

Coalesced was generally slightly faster than blocked, highlighting the differences between CPU and GPU prefetching. Odyssey GPUs have many cores and can take advantage of many work groups and threads.
